# This is the .ReadMe for the Dungeon Crawler

*The Dungeon Crawler is a command line game, the objective of the game is to get the character "@" to the Exit* 
## About the project
The project is a command line game, is uses commands inputted by the user to then move and respond to the character so that it can make its way around the map and either kill the monsters, collects a coin and/or finnishes the game if the player uses the game in that way. It stops at the walls what is identified as '#' and if the player hits them, the player will not move, this is the same as the monsters, thge player can not go through them but if the kill them using the 'Spacebar' they can kill them and then go though them as they have been killed. It also has diffrent maps so that the player has diffrent options to play and they will not get bored.

## Requirements
*This is what my game does*
My game has mutiple requirements that are needed in the game, the game has 3 levels that can be used, it lets thhe player move aroud the map after the user has pressed enter, i did this by the computer recording what the player inserts and set it to what posistion the user wants it to go in, what then inputs the data into the game so the user can move. The requirments also state that the player has to start on the 'S', by doing this i set the user character (what is displayed as a '@') to always start on the 'S', i did this by setting the map to find what thhe x axis and y axis of the 'S' is and set that as the posistion of the '@'. It also states that the user can not go into walls so i set it so that if the user next posisiton is a '#' it will not move. I also got some of the advanced requirments to do like the user to collect coins and attack/kil the monsters.
